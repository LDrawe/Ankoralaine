<h1 align="center">Ankoralaine Icon Theme</h1>

<p>
Ankoralaine is a icon theme that combines the icons from Antu, Kora and La Capitaine. The aim of this icon theme is to provide a more visually appealing set of icons for Plasma.

<p>
Those 3 icon themes are among the best out there in my opinion. But there was always something in then that would bother me, either some icons that didn't fit my taste, or one that was missing, etc. That's why I picked the icons that I liked best from each one and merged into this theme
